3. **Configuration:**
	
Database set-up:
- Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database and create a free database using the following options: 
	- Shared cluster (free) 
	- Cloud Provider: AWS 
	- Region: Any
  
- After creating the database, navigate to ‘Quickstart’ under the ‘Security’ section and create a user.
- Next, navigate to ‘Network Access’ and add your IP address.
  
To get your URI that will be used in the next step, navigate to ‘Database’ under ‘Deployment’. Locate your database and click on ‘Connect’. A pop-up window will appear. In this pop-up window, select the ‘Drivers’ option. Your database’s URI should be visible now. Copy it as it will be used in the next step.

Mailtrap set-up:
- Go to https://mailtrap.io/ and create a free mailtrap account.
- After creating an account, click on "Sending Domains" located on the left menus.
- Add your domain and verify to start sending emails.

Once your domain is set-up, you will be able to find your mailtrap USER_NAME and PASSWORD on that same page or in settings. Add the following information using the Environment set-up below.

NinjaManager Roles set-up:
NinjaManager currently has 3 roles: employee, admin, and owner. Both owner and admins can assign admins to employees using the "users" dropdown menu which allows users with those roles to delete tasks from the "History" page, however, only the Owner can remove admin privileges and remove users from the database. To assign ownership, you can do one of the 2 options:
- During your `.env` file setup, input your email for the variable "OWNER_EMAIL" BEFORE account creation, or
- Creating the FIRST account after pulling this code will automatically assign ownership.

Environment set-up:
- Create a `.env` file in the backend folder.
- Add your environment variables to the `.env` file.

  Example:
  
     	PORT=4000
     	MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@mernapp.l0dhnve.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        OWNER_EMAIL="owner_email@gmail.com"
        DOMAIN_NAME="http://name_of_website.com"
        SECRET=randomsecrethashedwordthatissecurectrlaltdelete
        EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SECRET=randsecretemailverifwordctrlaltdelete
        EMAIL_USERNAME="mailtrap_username"
        EMAIL_PASSWORD="mailtrap_password"
      
      
Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual credentials.
Replace `OWNER_EMAIL` with your email.
Replace `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your mailtrap username and password.

4. **Connect to Backend Server, Database, and starting Development Server:**
   - In the terminal, run the following command in the root directory:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. **App Startup:**
   - The app should start up.
